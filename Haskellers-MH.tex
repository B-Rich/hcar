Haskellers is a site designed to promote Haskell as a language for use in the real world by being a central meeting place for the myriad talented Haskell developers out there. It allows users to create profiles complete with skill sets and packages authored and gives employers a central place to find Haskell professionals.

Since the May 2011 HCAR, Haskellers has added polls, which provides a convenient means of surveying a large cross-section of the active Haskell community. There are now over 1300 active accounts, versus 800 one year ago.

Haskellers remains a site intended for all members of the Haskell community, from professionals with 15 years experience to people just getting into the language.
