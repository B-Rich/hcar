Warp is a high performance, easy to deploy HTTP server backend for
WAI \cref{wai}.  Since the last HCAR, Warp has switched from enumerators to conduits~\cref{conduit}, added SSL support, and websockets integration.

Due to the combined use of ByteStrings, blaze-builder, conduit, and GHC's improved I/O manager, WAI+Warp has consistently proven to be Haskell's most performant web deployment option.

Warp is actively used to serve up most of the users of WAI (and Yesod).
